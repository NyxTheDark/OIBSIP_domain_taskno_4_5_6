## Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

### Definition and Overview

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. These attacks render services unavailable to legitimate users.

### Types of DoS Attacks

#### 1. Volume-Based Attacks

- **UDP Floods**: Overwhelm random ports with UDP packets

- **Slowloris**: Keep connections open by sending partial requests
- **DNS Query Flood**: Overwhelm DNS servers

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

DDoS attacks use multiple compromised systems (botnets) to launch coordinated attacks, making them more powerful and harder to mitigate than single-source DoS attacks.

### How DoS/DDoS Attacks Work

1. Identification of target, it can be a individual, server, company, etc.
2. Resources Consumption or causing buffer overflow, that leads to service shutdown or system crashes.
4. Then the attacked is maintained for long time (Persistence) to maximize the effect.

### Impact of DoS/DDoS Attacks

## Conclusion

Network security threats continue to evolve in sophistication and scale, presenting ongoing challenges for organizations worldwide. The three primary threats examined in this report—DoS/DDoS attacks, MITM attacks, and spoofing—represent fundamental attack vectors that cybercriminals exploit to compromise systems, steal data, and disrupt operations.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Multi-Layered Defense**: No single security measure is sufficient; organizations must implement defense-in-depth strategies combining technical controls, policies, and user education.

2. **Proactive Approach**: Reactive security measures are insufficient; organizations must actively monitor, assess, and improve their security posture continuously.

3. **Human Factor**: Many successful attacks exploit human vulnerabilities through social engineering; comprehensive security awareness training is essential.

4. **Emerging Threats**: The threat landscape constantly evolves; organizations must stay informed about new attack methods and adapt their defenses accordingly.

5. **Incident Preparedness**: Despite best prevention efforts, security incidents will occur; effective incident response capabilities are crucial for minimizing impact.

### Future Considerations

As technology advances, new threats will emerge:
- **IoT Security**: Proliferation of connected devices creates new attack surfaces
- **Cloud Security**: Migration to cloud services introduces new risks and responsibilities
- **AI-Powered Attacks**: Machine learning enhances attacker capabilities
- **Quantum Computing**: Future threat to current cryptographic methods
- **5G Networks**: New infrastructure brings new vulnerabilities
